% This structure must correspond to the part labels passed to annotateParts().

% The above example array corresponds to the tree structure below, which
% indicates that parts 0 and 3 are not attached to any other parts,
% but part 1 is a member of a chain of parts, being a attached to part 2,
% which is attached to part 4, which is attached to part 5. Here are three
% examples of what parts 1, 2, 4, and 5 could look like, given this tree:

%   1     1 2 4 5     1
%   2                 2 4
%   4                   5
%   5

% You could think of the example tree structure representing an upper arm,
% lower arm, hand, and fingers.
